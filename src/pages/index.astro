          >hilip J. Rhea</span
        > is a native Floridian who attended a Catholic private high school in St.
        Mary's, KS and then spent two years at a seminary in Minnesota discerning
        his vocation. During that time he had the opportunity to travel through Italy,
        Switzerland and France. He fell in love with art and architecture and resolved
        to pursue a career in that field.<br /><br /> Philip began his architectural
        education at a community college, worked for an architect in Orlando for
        a year and then transferred to the University of Florida where he earned
        a Bachelor of Science in Architecture. In order to maintain a balanced architectural
        diet, he minored in Urban Regional Planning, became an active member in the
        Institute of Classical Architecture & Art, joined the TradArch list, studied
        Historic Preservation, and built a good library. Because of his experiences
        with modernist architecture and philosophy, he resolved to dedicate all of
        his efforts to traditional architecture rooted in the perennial philosophies
        that uphold the true, the beautiful and the good. From then on, all roads
        led to the University of Notre Dame. He has completed a Masters in Architecture
        with a concentration in Classical Architecture - Deo Gratias!<br /><br
        /> Philip has successfully completed the NCARB test requirements and has
        received an architectural license in the State of Florida. He has worked
        in Seaside and Miami, FL and has recently relocated to Jacksonville.
        <br /><br />Philip loves all outdoor activities, will play any sport,
        and enjoys working on cars. He was a member of the Collegium Musicum at
        Notre Dame and is currently the choir director of sacred music at the
        church he attends. He is married to a wonderful young lady who could not
        encourage him more in his interests and desires for everything
        beautiful. They currently have six children.
